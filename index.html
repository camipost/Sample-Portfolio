<div class="aboutMe">
  <p> My name is Cami Post and I am a senior at Ohio University majoring in Visual Communications. I specialize in Publication Design and am obtaining a Psychology minor. In high school, I did a Career Technical program in Commercial Arts. This began my love of art and graphic design. I’m proficient in the Adobe suite and somewhat familiar with HTML5 and CSS. I’m best at using Photoshop and InDesign.
</p>
<p>I work for the Director of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity as a designer. I do the designs for Science Cafes, Café Conversations, and Grant workshops/proposals. I had an amazing opportunity from this job as the head designer for the Student Expo. I created a logo design for the event and promotional materials. This includes print and social media for the event. I had a position for an organization on campus called University Programming Council. I was a Graphic Design Executive therefore, I created posters for the events the organization would put on. I’ve also free-lanced for publications, such as 1804 and Thread Magazine, during my time here.
